# Python-Neural-Network-and-deep-learing-Project
This project consist of two smaller projects. The aim of this project is to learn about nerual networks and deep learing through the use of tensorflow and keras.

# 1.House Price Project
In this project, a neural network was trained to predict the value of a house given its characteristics such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms and even location within the US.
The model was trained using the kc_house data that consists of house prices from King County an area in the US State of Washington, this data also covers Seattle.
This project mainly utilized pythons SKlearn, Tensorflow and Keras.

# 2.Lending Club Prject
In this project, a model is built to predict wether or not a borrower from the Lending Club in the US will pay back their loan based on historical data.
The model is trained based off the lending club dataset from kaggle.
This project prooved to be very interesting as it involved Exploratory data analysis, Data pre-processing and Training and Evaluation of the model. 
As a result one can see how data science and machine learing come together and compliment each other.
Python Data Science libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn were used.
Python tensorflow, Keras and SKlearn was used in creating the model.
